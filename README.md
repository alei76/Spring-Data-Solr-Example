Spring-data-solr-example

Configuration
First we need a running Solr server. For simplicity reasons we will use the example configuration that comes with the current Solr release (4.10.2 at the time I am writing) and is described in the official Solr tutorial. So we only have to download Solr, extract it in a directory of our choice and then run java -jar start.jar from the <solr home>/example directory.
